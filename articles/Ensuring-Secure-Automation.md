# Ensuring Secure Automation: The Benefits and Standards of OPC UA Security in the Industrial Industry

OPC UA security is critical for the industrial automation industry, as it helps to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of process control and automation data. In this article, we will explore the benefits of OPC UA security and why it is based on international standards.

## Benefits of OPC UA Security for Industry:

1. Protects Sensitive Data: OPC UA security helps to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and tampering. This is particularly important for industries that handle sensitive information, such as financial and healthcare industries.

2. Enhances System Reliability: By protecting against unauthorized access and tampering, OPC UA security helps to ensure the reliability and stability of industrial control systems. This can prevent system failures and downtime, resulting in increased productivity and reduced costs.

3. Supports Compliance: OPC UA security helps organizations meet various security and compliance regulations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 standard for information security management.

### Why OPC UA Security is Based on International Standards:

OPC UA security is based on international standards to ensure interoperability and consistency across different systems and vendors. This helps to prevent vendor lock-in and ensures that different systems can securely communicate with each other.

## The standards that OPC UA security is based on include:

- ISO/IEC 27001: This standard specifies the requirements for information security management systems (ISMS), including the implementation of security controls and the management of risks.

- ISO/IEC 29167: This standard specifies the requirements for digital signatures and the generation and verification of digital signatures.

- ISO/IEC 11801: This standard specifies the requirements for cabling and communications technologies used in building automation and control systems.

In conclusion, OPC UA security is critical for the industrial automation industry and provides numerous benefits, including the protection of sensitive data, enhanced system reliability, and support for compliance. By being based on international standards, OPC UA security ensures interoperability and consistency across different systems and vendors, helping to prevent vendor lock-in and ensuring secure communication between systems.
