# Protocol Support Guide

Node4i supports several industrial protocols to provide a seamless integration with various devices and systems. Below is a list of the supported protocols and how they are mapped to the Node4i platform.

## OPC UA
OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is a machine-to-machine communication protocol designed for industrial automation. It provides a secure and reliable communication mechanism for exchanging real-time data between devices, systems, and applications in an industrial environment.

In Node4i, OPC UA is used to communicate with devices and systems that support this protocol, including PLCs, HMIs, SCADA systems, and more. The Node4i platform supports both client and server mode for OPC UA communication.

## Modbus
Modbus is a serial communication protocol widely used in industrial automation. It provides a simple and flexible communication mechanism for exchanging data between devices, systems, and applications.

In Node4i, Modbus is used to communicate with devices and systems that support this protocol, including PLCs, RTUs, and more. The Node4i platform supports both Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP for communication.

## S7 Siemens
S7 Siemens is a proprietary communication protocol used by Siemens PLCs. It provides a secure and reliable communication mechanism for exchanging real-time data between Siemens PLCs and other devices, systems, and applications.

In Node4i, S7 Siemens is used to communicate with Siemens PLCs. The Node4i platform supports communication with Siemens PLCs using the S7 Siemens protocol.

## HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a widely used communication protocol for exchanging data over the internet. It provides a simple and flexible communication mechanism for exchanging data between devices, systems, and applications.

In Node4i, HTTP is used to communicate with devices and systems that support this protocol, including web services, cloud-based systems, and more. The Node4i platform supports both HTTP and HTTPS for communication.

## MQTT
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a machine-to-machine communication protocol designed for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It provides a secure and reliable communication mechanism for exchanging real-time data between devices, systems, and applications.

In Node4i, MQTT is used to communicate with devices and systems that support this protocol, including IoT devices, cloud-based systems, and more. The Node4i platform supports MQTT for communication.

## AMQP
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard for messaging middleware. It provides a secure and reliable communication mechanism for exchanging real-time data between devices, systems, and applications.

In Node4i, AMQP is used to communicate with devices and systems that support this protocol, including message brokers, cloud-based systems, and more. The Node4i platform supports AMQP for communication.

## Kafka
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed for handling high-volume, real-time data streams. It provides a secure and reliable communication mechanism for exchanging real-time data between devices, systems, and applications.

In Node4i, Kafka is used to communicate with devices and systems that support this protocol, including cloud-based systems, streaming platforms, and more. The Node4i platform supports Kafka for communication.

## Protocol Mapping

Node4i maps various communication protocols, such as MQTT, to OPC UA nodes, providing a unified and standardized interface for industrial devices to interact with each other and exchange data.

For example, MQTT topics can be mapped to OPC UA nodes, allowing devices that use MQTT for communication to interact with devices that use OPC UA. This mapping enables real-time data exchange between devices, making it possible to integrate systems and improve the overall efficiency of industrial processes.

By providing a unified and standardized interface, Node4i makes it easy to integrate different industrial devices and systems, regardless of their communication protocols.


## IO Mapping and Flexible Functionality

Node4i provides a robust and flexible way to map Input/Output (IO) signals to nodes in the OPC UA server. This enables bi-directional communication between the IO signals and the runtime components in the Factory Tree, giving you greater control and customization over your industrial automation systems.

With its built-in support for common protocols like MQTT, Modbus, and OPC UA, Node4i makes it easy to integrate with a wide range of industrial devices and systems. The mapping feature allows you to seamlessly connect these devices to nodes in the OPC UA server, eliminating the need for complex integration work.

The mapping process is straightforward and intuitive. Simply specify the IO signals you want to map, and Node4i will automatically create the necessary nodes and relationships in the Factory Tree. This makes it easy to mix and match IO signals with runtime components, giving you greater control and flexibility over your industrial automation systems.

Using the mapping feature, you can:

- Connect industrial devices and systems to the OPC UA server
- Create bi-directional communication between IO signals and runtime components
- Easily map IO signals to nodes in the Factory Tree
- Mix and match IO signals with runtime components for greater control and flexibility

Overall, the IO mapping and flexible functionality in Node4i provide a powerful and versatile tool for industrial automation systems, giving you greater control, flexibility, and integration capabilities.
