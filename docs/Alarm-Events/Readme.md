### Steps for Alarm & Event Creation

1. Create a Condition Class: The first step in creating an Alarm is to create a condition class. This can be done
   through the Alarm & Events management dashboard by choosing the Alarm & Events option from the menu.

2. Fill Alarm Inputs: The inputs required for creating an Alarm are:

    - name: A unique name to identify the alarm.

    - displayName: The display name of the alarm, which is used for user-friendly representation in the user interface.

    - location: The location where the alarm is triggered. It can be a physical location or a logical one.

    - conditionClassName: The name of the condition class that the alarm belongs to. The condition class defines the
      type of alarm and its behavior.

    - severity: The severity level of the alarm, which indicates its importance and impact on the process. The severity
      levels can be defined as high, medium, or low.

    - message: A descriptive message that provides more information about the alarm.

    - condition: The condition that triggers the alarm. It can be a simple expression or a complex formula.

    - offDelay: The time delay after which the alarm is cleared after the condition is no longer met.

    - onDelay: The time delay after which the alarm is triggered after the condition is met.

    - maxTimeShelved: The maximum time the alarm is shelved, during which the alarm is temporarily disabled.

    - triggerNodes: The nodes that trigger the alarm. It can be a single node or multiple nodes.

    - enabled: A boolean value that indicates whether the alarm is enabled or disabled.

    - history: The historical data of the alarm, which can be used for reporting and analysis.

### Group Alarms:

- Alarms can also be grouped by a group name, which allows you to better organize and manage your alarms.

Here are a few example use cases of Node4i in the mining, truck dispatching, and smart transportation industries:

1. Mining: In the mining industry, Node4i can be used to monitor the safety and health conditions of miners. The alarms
   and events feature can be used to alert managers if the oxygen levels in a mine fall below a certain level or if
   there is a gas leak, for example. The IO management feature can be used to control the ventilation system in the
   mine, ensuring that miners have access to clean air. The runtime components feature can be used to automate various
   processes in the mine, such as controlling the flow of ore from one location to another.

2. Truck Dispatching: In the truck dispatching industry, Node4i can be used to track the location and status of trucks
   on the road. The alarms and events feature can be used to alert dispatchers if a truck is running low on fuel or if
   it is involved in an accident. The IO management feature can be used to communicate with the trucks, sending them
   updates on their delivery schedules and routes. The runtime components feature can be used to automate various
   processes in the dispatching center, such as generating reports and sending invoices.

3. Smart Transportation: In the smart transportation industry, Node4i can be used to monitor and control various systems
   in vehicles and on roads. The alarms and events feature can be used to alert drivers if there is a problem with their
   vehicle, such as a flat tire. The IO management feature can be used to communicate with the vehicles, sending them
   updates on traffic conditions and helping them avoid congestion. The runtime components feature can be used to
   automate various processes in the transportation system, such as generating reports on vehicle usage and fuel
   consumption.

In all of these industries, Node4i helps to improve efficiency, increase safety, and reduce costs by automating
processes and monitoring critical systems.
